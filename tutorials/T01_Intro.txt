Introduction

* Languages I have taught myself

	-Basic
	-Smalltalk
	-c
	-c++
	-Visual Basic
	-vb.net
	-java
	-Lua (durring my WoW phase)
	
* Why I like Rust

	-While I like java it is not open source and I like it less 
		after Oracle bought it
		
	-.Net is not open source..
	
	-Programming with c and c++ is difficult to use for large projects. 
	
	-Rust is 100% Open Source
	
	-Rust's super picky compiler and well structure enforces safe 
		programming practices while leaving executable code that is about 
		as fast as c++	
		
	-Rust's documentation is awesome, no really.
	
	-The Rust Tutorial http://www.rust-lang.org/

* To learn Rust, I'll try to write Must, and make Rust tutorials
