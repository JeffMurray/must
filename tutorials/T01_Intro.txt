Introduction

* Languages I have taught myself

	-Basic
	-Smalltalk
	-c
	-c++
	-Visual Basic (Access yada yada)
	-vb.net
	-java
	-Lua (durring my WoW phase)
	
* Why I like Rust

	-While I like java it is not open source and I like it less 
		after Oracle bought it
		
	-.Net is not open source and Microsoft is clueless.
	
	-Programming with c and c++ is difficult to use for large projects. 
	
	-Google is making go, but lets not take all the eggs from, one set of
		and put them in another
		
	-Rust is 100% Open Source, which means Rust's documentation is awesome..
	
	-Rust's super picky compiler and structure enforces safe programming 
		practices while leaving executable code that is about as fast
		as c++
		
	-Rust's robust robust task spawning and communication channels are powerful

	-The Rust Tutorial http://www.rust-lang.org/
	
* Who will program in Rust?  I think there are a lot of disgruntled java 
		and .net programmers that have reason to pick it up.  It will be
		fun to watch.
		
* To learn Rust, I'll try to write Must, and make Rust tutorials
