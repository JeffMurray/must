I plan to record some live screen and voice sessions that follow the agenda in the text files.

This is a work in progress and is a weekend and evenings personal project at the moment.

I am working on the examples now, and when I finish out par.rs and fit.rs, I will record the live screen shots with commentary.

It will document my attempts to put Rust to my service in making the underpinnings of a potential new document system called Must.

I don't know if Must will succeed "in the large", but I certainly want to find out what Rust is about.

In these original .rs files, there are/will be some meaty examples of a fairly wide range of Rust features.
