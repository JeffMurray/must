This project was just playing around learning rust.

This code has long been abandoned.


Must Document System
====

This code is a work in progress and is a weekend and evenings personal project at the moment.

Must already has some interesting concepts like programmable argument relays and JSON encoded logic strands, and I plan to add a new (to me) lurker index for a versioned master index.  I also plan on interfacing with Spider Monkey to add couchDB style custom b+tree indexes that are versioned in a unique way I will explain later.

If you see ways I can improve this code, please open an issue or something.  I am new to Rust, and expect that there may be better ways to do this or that, and I always want to learn.

If you are interested in contributing content, I would also like to talk to you.  A wide open controbution could be making a Fit (Functionally Isolated Task) to house a Spider Monkey interface (https://github.com/pcwalton/rust-spidermonkey).  Or let me know if you have other ideas.
