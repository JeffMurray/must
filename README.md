Must Document System

This is a work in progress and is a weekend and evenings personal project at the moment.

This project cronicals my attempts to put Rust to my service by making the underpinnings of a potential new document system called Must.

I started this project as a vehicle to learn Rust.  The project already has some interesting concepts like programmable argument relays and JSON encoded logic strands, and I plan to add a new (to me) lurker index for a versioned master index.  I also plan on interfacing with Spider Monkey to add couchDB style custom b+tree indexes that are versioned in a unique way I will explain later.

If you are an advanced Rust Programmer and see ways I can improve this code, please open an issue or something.  I am new to Rust, and expect that there may be better ways to do this or that, and want to learn.

If you are interesting in contributing, I would also like to talk to you.  A wide open controbution could be the Spider Monkey interface for example.
